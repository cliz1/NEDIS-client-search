# NEDIS Client Search Desktop App

## Purpose

This is a desktop application built with Tkinter for searching and managing client information.
The data is collected by the organization in google forms, and the data is extracted and processed using the google sheets API.
The purpose of the application is to quickly display certain information or sort data in ways that is not easily done in google sheets.
The app provides specific metrics such as how many times a client recieved a particular service, which is valuable data while applying for grants. 

## Features

- Search for clients by name, town.
- View detailed client information, including how many services they have recieved from each advocate/service type.
- Sort clients by number of services recieved within each category.
- Search collaborators (other local organizations) to display a list of collaboration sessions and other collaborator data.

  ## Usage

In its current state, the app is highly customized to the specific needs of the organization and therefore is not yet practically 
usable to anyone outside the NEDIS organization. The next step of the project is to convert it to a web application, which is currently a WIP. 
After its conversion to web application it can potentially be expanded to fit the needs of any non profit organization seeking to use it.
